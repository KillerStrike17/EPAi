<h2 align="center"> Assignment Question </h2>

* Make sure you have formed a team. 
* Your team leader should visit this link: https://classroom.github.com/g/dFEjEHV9 (Links to an external site.)
  * team leader creates a team with a particular name, and then others join the same team. 
  * a new repo with that name would be created with that name (for example https://github.com/The-School-of-AI/session1-myteam (Links to an external site.))
* Your test won't even run. Because I have introduced an error in session1.py. I have added a TAB instead of space somewhere. You first need to fix that to get tests running. 
* Once you fix that test, visit GitHub's actions, click on GitHub Classroom WorkFlow >> Autograding, and then look at the test results. 
* You have 10 tests failing right now. 
* Read session1.py file carefully, as well as the failing instructions. 
  * Your tests are written in test_session1.py
  * Clone the repo on your computer, install pytest and then run pytest --tb=long 
  * Fix the tests first on your computer. 
* Since this is a practice for you and us as well, it is only 100 points. BUT:
  * Your final scores will be calculated with this formula:
    * finalscore=10x(10−totalcommits)
* Submission Due in 2 days (Jul 18, 2020, 22:00 IST), and closes automatically on GitHub ( 😁 GitHub does not provide any extension feature 🤣😂🤣😂😆😉)

Once we follow the above procedures listed in the question, we are exposed to repo which has a set of task listed for us. So lets solve them one at a time.

### Tasks

We have been given with a Rectangle Class. 

**Task 1:** Here we first need to change the representation of the class Rectange, we complete that class with overriding the `__repr__` function.

**Task 2:** Here we need to print the output in a specific format, hence to do so we override the `__str__` function.

**Task 3:** We have to raise an error on negative valueson input, so to do that we use `property` decorator. 

**Task 4:**
