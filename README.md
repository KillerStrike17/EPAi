Extensive Python & Pytorch for AI is Very Advance Python Course. This repository contains Assignment Question and Solution.

Website: 

It is an Awesome website, please go give a check..!!

1. [Python 101]()

    In this module we work over github classrooms i.e. setting up workflows and observing actions. In this we are also exposed to pytest to test our files. The assignment questions are very basic like changing representation of class and implementing basic test conditions and raising errors

2. [Object Mutability and Interning]()

    In this assignment we understand the memory usage and memory division in python. Here we write functions to understand and learn interning.
   
3. [Numeric Types I]()
   
    In this, I learned about inbuilt pythin functions like rounding off, ceil, floor, trunc and isclose. I reimplemented them and test them. 

4. [Numeric Types II]()
   
   In this Assignment we need to implement Qualean class. In this class we define all its __ functions like and, or, repr, str, add, eq, float, ge, gt, invertsign, le, lt, mul, sqrt, and bool. Then the class is being tested for all these functions.

5. [Funcational Parameters]()
   
    In this assignment we understand functions, we also understand the keyword and positional argument. Here I developed funcations like print, square_power, polygon area, temperature conversion and speed converter and tested them using pytest.

6. [First Class Functions]()
   
    Here, I Learned about Lambda, map and zip function. Using these funcation i created a mixed version of poker and teen patti. Here mixed rules of teen pathi and poker are used.  The game is made using lambda, map and zip functions and tested using pytest

7. [First Class Funcations II]()
   
    In this session, I explore list comprehensions and try to replace lambda and filter functions with it. Here i also explored reduce function. In the assignment I developed code to find the next fibonacci number, then i also implemented and test some functions to learn list comprehension and reduce funcationaities.

8. [Closure]()
   
    Here I learned about Closures, this is basically nested functions. I created closures to do a function count and store in a global variable and individual dictionary variable for each function. Then Closure to detect the presence of doc string, and to see the next generated fibonacci number. 

9. [Decorators]()
    
    In this Assignment I understood decorators, Now I understand that @names in fast.ai . Here in this assignment I created decorators to time the code, to authneticate a function, to log code, to run on odd times and to provide access right to variables based on the user type.

10. [Tuples and Named Tuples]()
    
    Here I learned that why tuples are important and how fast they are. Even I learned about named tuples, which have properties of tuples and classes. Here I implemented some functions i.e. to generate some fake profiles using faker and then performing operations over it. I Then profiled my named tuple code against dictionary and tested for performance.
    
11. [Modules]()
    
    We understand to create Modules. Here I created a simple image editor module. This module can convert png to jpg, jpg to png, image resizing and image cropping. We here also test the zip module. Here I understood how modules are implemented.
    
12. [Packages]()

    In this Assignment we learn to make packages. As a developer once should now how to make packages. Here we also learn how to abstract our packages for the user i.e. if someone does import package_name, then what all funcationalities should be included and if we do some other import thenwhat all has to be imported. Here we develop calculator package to perform some basic calculations

13. [Sequences]()
