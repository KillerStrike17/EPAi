<h2 align="center"> Assignment Solution </h2>

In this assignment we had to develop 2 modules i.e. polygon and polygon sequence and have to test them in the jupyter notebook. So lets address these modules one at a time. 

### Objective 1

* Here I create a class named `Polygon` which has a constructor which takes in `no_of_edges` and `circumradius` as parameters and uses this value to initialize local variables. 

* To get the properties i.e. `interior angle`, `edge length`, `apothem`, `area` & `perimeter`. I defined functions for each property using the formula mentioned in the question and added a property decorator over it.

* For functionalities, I overrided `__repr__` function to get custom representation of class. I overrided `__eq__` function to check fr equality, this funcation takes in `polygon` class object and checks the `no_of_edges` and `circumradius`, if both these values of argument class and self class are equal then it returns `True` else returns `False`. A similar logic is used for `__gt__` function.

### Objective 2

* Here I create a class named `Polygon_seq` which has a constructor which takes in `no_of_edges` and `circumradius` as parameters and uses this value to initialize local variables. 

* To get the property i.e `max_efficieny` I compare the dictionary values containing the ratio to get the maximum value out of it. 

* For functionalities, I overrided `__repr__` function to get custom representation of class. I overrided `__len__` function which returns the `no_of_edges` as output and I also overrided `__getitem__` function to return the ratio in a sequence type i.e. defining a custom sequence. 


## Test Cases

Test cases have been developed in the notebook to check the `Objective 1` and `Objective 2`. There are two sections in the notebook, first section tests `objective 1` over `properties`, `__repr__`,`__eq__` & `__gt__` function. The second section contains the test cases for `objective 2` over `properties`,`__repr__`, `__len__` & `__getitem__`.
